# FOS-Kernel

### Memory Management System

**Project Specifications :**

1. Kernel heap: allow the kernel to dynamically allocate and free memory space at run-time (for user directory, page tables â€¦etc.)

2. Load and run multiple user programs that are partially loaded in main memory and fully
loaded in secondary memory (H.D.D.) 

3. Handle page faults during execution by applying FIFO replacement algorithm.

4. Semaphores: OS-supported solution for concurrency problems (critical section & dependency).

5. User heap: Allow user program to dynamically allocate and free memory space at run-time (i.e. malloc and free functions) by applying FIRST FIT strategy.

6. Shared variables: Allow user programs to dynamically create and share variables at run-time
by applying FIRST FIT strategy
